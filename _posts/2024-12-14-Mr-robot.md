## VulnHub: Mr. Robot

Hello, and welcome to my first project on a VulnHub vulnerable machine!

Today we are working on VM called [Mr Robot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) which is themed after the show Mr. Robot. I have previously participated in CTFs challenges during my studies at the University of Richmond boot camps: however, this is my first time doing one independently.

Before we begin, if you haven't heard of [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/about/), then let me briefly explain what it is. Their goal is to provide materials that allow anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration. Vulnhub was born to cover as many resources as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practise 'stuff' out.

## Description:

Based on the show, Mr. Robot.

This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find.

The VM isn't too difficult. There isn't any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate

## Let's Begin!
To begin, I ran an [nmap](https://nmap.org/) scan to find and scan any open ports on a range of IPs. Using [Virtualbox's Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-dhcpserver) to create a DHCP server I hosted the Mr. Robot and Kali linux VMs on an [Internal Network](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_internal). Fortunately for me i knew the range of IPs.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -sS -sV -T4 10.38.1.51   
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-15 02:21 EST
mass_dns: warning: Unable to open /etc/resolv.conf. Try using --system-dns or specify valid servers with --dns-servers: No such file or directory (2)
mass_dns: warning: Unable to determine any DNS servers. Reverse DNS is disabled. Try using --system-dns or specify valid servers with --dns-servers
Nmap scan report for 10.38.1.51
Host is up (0.00035s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd
MAC Address: ----------------- (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
```

From our scan I can see that ports 80 and 443 are open. It is also running Apache HTTPD, leading me to assume It’s a web server.

Now let's take a look at this website by typing the IP in my web browser!

<figure style="width: 1100px">
  <img src="/images/mr-robot-website.PNG">
</figure>

The website doesn’t offer much other than 6 commands, each one doing a unique task, however none of the commands provide any good information.

I decided to take a look at the /robots.txt to see if I can reveal any sensitive information.

```yaml
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```
Off the bat we can see the first flag!
```yaml
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```
When navigating to /fsocity.dic it prompted a download which seemed to be a wordlist I could potentially use later in a brute force attack.

Since I know it’s a web server I ran [nikto](https://sectools.org/tool/nikto/) to scan the website for potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

```console

```
There are some Interesting things shown from this scan:

Right away I tried accessing /index.html which made my web browser endlessly load and /index.php brought me back to the main page.

Next I tried /readme.html which displayed the following message:

```yaml
I like where you head is at. However I'm not going to help you. 
```
Before I went further I tried running a [wpscan](https://wpscan.com/wordpress-cli-scanner/) against the website; however, since I didn’t update the database before putting it on an internal network wpscan wouldn’t work.

This left me with two options: the /wp-login.php page and /license.txt. I went ahead and tried accessing /license.txt which displayed the following:
```yaml
what you do just pull code from Rapid9 or some s@#% since when did you become a script kitty?
do you want a password or something?
ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=
```
After trying to identify this hash with hashid and failed I did a little research and realized it was base64 encoded. After using [Base64 Decode](https://www.base64decode.org/) it gave me a username and password.

```yaml
elliot:ER28-0652
```
Now I can try logging in at /wp-login.php!

<figure style="width: 500px" figure class ="align-center">
  <img src="/images/wordpressloginpage.PNG">
</figure>
<figure style="width: 1000px" figure class ="align-center">
  <img src="/images/signedinwplogin.PNG">
</figure>

After successfully logging in, I took a look around and noticed the user elliot was an administor  account. Additionally, I looked at the plugins page that could potentially be useful. However, since I already had access to an admin account and was unable to utilize WPScan, I opted to search for a WordPress exploit using [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/).


```console
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.31.1.50:4444 
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: not-found: The target does not appear to be using WordPress
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
```
At this point, i was stuck. After extensive research, i discovered two methods to disable the wpscan check for website. The first method involved using the option set WPCHECK false.

```yaml

```
