Hello, and welcome to my first project on a VulnHub vulnerable machine!

Today we are working on VM called [Mr Robot 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) which is themed after the show Mr. Robot. I have previously participated in CTFs challenges during my studies at the University of Richmond boot camps: however, this is my first time doing one independently.

Before we begin, if you haven't heard of [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/about/), then let me briefly explain what it is. Their goal is to provide materials that allow anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration. Vulnhub was born to cover as many resources as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practise 'stuff' out.

## Description:

Based on the show, Mr. Robot.

This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find.

The VM isn't too difficult. There isn't any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate

## Let's Begin!
To begin, I ran an [nmap](https://nmap.org/) scan to find and scan any open ports on a range of IPs. Using [Virtualbox's Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-dhcpserver) to create a DHCP server I hosted the Mr. Robot and Kali linux VMs on an [Internal Network](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_internal). Fortunately for me i knew the range of IPs.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -sS -sV -T4 10.38.1.51   
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-15 02:21 EST
mass_dns: warning: Unable to open /etc/resolv.conf. Try using --system-dns or specify valid servers with --dns-servers: No such file or directory (2)
mass_dns: warning: Unable to determine any DNS servers. Reverse DNS is disabled. Try using --system-dns or specify valid servers with --dns-servers
Nmap scan report for 10.38.1.51
Host is up (0.00035s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd
MAC Address: ----------------- (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
```

From our scan I can see that ports 80 and 443 are open. It is also running Apache HTTPD, leading me to assume It’s a web server.

Now let's take a look at this website by typing the IP in my web browser!

</figure>

The website doesn’t offer much other than 6 commands, each one doing a unique task, however none of the commands provide any good information.

I decided to take a look at the /robots.txt to see if I can reveal any sensitive information.

```yaml
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```
Off the bat we can see the first flag!
```yaml
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```
When navigating to /fsocity.dic it prompted a download which seemed to be a wordlist I could potentially use later in a brute force attack.

Since I know it’s a web server I run [nikto](https://sectools.org/tool/nikto/) to scan the website for potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
